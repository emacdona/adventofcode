;; We could, for each interior tree, check to see if it's visible
;; from north, south, east, or west and if so, count it. That sounds
;; TERRIBLY expensive computationally.
;;
;; So, instead, we could traverse each row from left to right and
;; record all trees that ARE visible (as a tuple of their coordinates).
;; Then do the same from right-to-left, top-to-bottom, and 
;; bottom-to-top... and count the size of the union of all four
;; sets of tuples.
